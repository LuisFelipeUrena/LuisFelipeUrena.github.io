**Americans love to eat out**, on recent surveys 56% of the population dines at a restaurant, get take out ot have a meal
delivered 2 to 3 times a week, since i started my new education in data science i asked myself, what are the cities in the USA that
have to most mexican restaurants in the USA, *in my case i love mexican food, so it was something i wanted to dig into*.

i sourced a dataset that had over 77,000 records of restaurants across the US, that sold mexican food, so i narrowed down my search
and here are the winners.

 ### These graphs describe the top 10 cities and the quantity of restaurants in each of them
